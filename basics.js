///// Question 1
// Write a loop that would log each element of the array below to the console,
// prefixed with the text "I have a " (so "I have a cat", "I have a dog", etc.)

var pets = ['cat', 'dog', 'wombat'];
for(var i=0; i<=pets.length-1; i++){
  console.log("I have a " + pets[i]);

}

//FOR-EACH
  var iHaveA =  function(element){
    return "I have a " + element;


  }
  console.log(pets.map(iHaveA));
  pets.forEach(iHaveA)
///// Question 2
// Change my friend's hair color to "green", without modifying the line below.

var friend = { name: 'Chris', age: 27, hairColor: 'blue' };
friend.hairColor = 'green'

///// Question 3
// The function below is problematic. In 1-2 sentences explain why, and then fix the code.


 // Squared is currently a global variable, though the function will work, this may cause fufture problems.
var squarePlusOne = function(n){
   var squared
  squared = n * n;
  return squared + 1;
};

///// Question 4
// Translate the Ruby method defined below into a JavaScript function.

/*
def greet(name, excited)
  greeting = "Hi, #{name} here!"
  if excited == true
    greeting.upcase
  else
    greeting
  end
end
*/

var greet = function(name, excited){
  var greeting = "Hi, " + name + " here!"

  if(excited == true){ // can also just say if(excited) ==> and js will implicitly assume truthiness
     return greeting.toUpperCase();
  } else{
    return greeting;
  }
  }



///// Question 5
// Consider the following code.

var anna = {name: "Anna",
            age: 28,
            luckyNumber: function() {
              return this.age*2;
            }
          }

// What is `anna`? (e.g. method, function, string, etc.)
  anna is an Object; like a hash in ruby.

// What are `name`, `age`, and `luckyNumber`?
these are Properties.


// What does `this` refer to?
this  refers to the object anna.


// If you are in console.log and you want to see anna's lucky number, how would you do that?
anna.luckyNumber()

// If you want to change anna's name to wurble, how would you do that?
anna.name = 'Wurble'
