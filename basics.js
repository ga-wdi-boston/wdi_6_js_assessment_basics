///// Question 1
// Write a loop that would log each element of the array below to the console,
// prefixed with the text "I have a " (so "I have a cat", "I have a dog", etc.)

var pets = ['cat', 'dog', 'wombat'];
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {console.log("I have a " + pets[i]);}

///// Question 2
// Change my friend's hair color to "green", without modifying the line below.
var friend = { name: 'Chris', age: 27, hairColor: 'blue' };
friend.hairColor = 'green';

///// Question 3
// The function below is problematic. In 1-2 sentences explain why, and then fix the code.
var squarePlusOne = function(n){
  // squared = n * n;
  // return squared + 1;
  // There's no need to do this in two lines, or create an additional *global* variable in order to do so. Better version below.
  return n*n + 1;
};

///// Question 4
// Translate the Ruby method defined below into a JavaScript function.

/*
def greet(name, excited)
  greeting = "Hi, #{name} here!"
  if excited == true
    greeting.upcase
  else
    greeting
  end
end
*/
function greet(name, excited) {
  var greeting = "Hi, " + name + " here!";
  if (excited) {
    return greeting.toUpperCase();
  else 
    return greeting;
  }
}


///// Question 5
// Consider the following code.
var anna = {name: "Anna",
            age: 28,
            luckyNumber: function() {
              return this.age*2;
            }
          }
// What is `anna`? (e.g. method, function, string, etc.) 
A variable containing a hash/JS object.

// What are `name`, `age`, and `luckyNumber`? 
Symbols being used as keys in the hash/JS object. Could also be though of as the attributes and functions that the object posesses.

// What does `this` refer to? 
In this context, 'this' refers to the specific object that is calling the anonynous function. In other words, since the age for the 'anna' object is 28,
the 'luckyNumber' function should return the value 56.

// If you want to return the value of anna's lucky number, how would you do that? 
return anna.luckyNumber()

// If you want to change anna's name to "wurble", how would you do that? 
anna.name = "wurble"
